Building My Own Portfolio Site, Open to any suggestions.
Contents to be added are:

  * Languages and Frameworks I am comfortable with
  * Works (Projects, Resume)
  * Hackathons
  * Internships

    Well, the website looks great! If you add a few more things then it'll be complete :)
    Some of them are:
  * Awards and accomplishments
  * Soft skills 

> Will Be Refactoring A lot!
